					        <p style="margin-top:60px;">This graph illustrates the revenue made on customer trips for time periods beyond the 30 minute free (i.e., no additional charge) use for June 2016. There were a total of 39749 trips exceeding 30 minutes; this totaled 25% of all trips. Customers are charged an additional $4 for each additional 15 minute period beyond the 30 minute limit. Data up to 180 minutes is shown; revenue was made from longer trips, but the highest revenues were garnered from times up to 180 minutes. 42% of revenue for rides beyond 30 minutes was taken from rides lasting between 30 and 180 minutes. 13% of the revenue was taken from rides lasting between 30 and 45 minutes.</p>
