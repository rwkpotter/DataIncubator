					        <p style="margin-top:60px;">This graph illustrates the average trip time (in minutes) for customers and subscribers for July 2013, June 2014, June 2015, and June 2016. Note that the average trip time for customers is ~2-3x greater than that for subscribers. The average trip time for customers has increased annually (up almost 40% from 2013 to 2016), while average trip time for subscribers decreased through 2015, increasing to approximately 2013 numbers in 2016. Finally, the average trip time for customers exceeds the 30 minute no additional charge threshold. This means that, on average, the scheme is receiving $4 more per trip than in previous years.</p>
