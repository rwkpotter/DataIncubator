					        <p style="margin-top:60px;">This graph illustrates the total trips taken (encompassing all stations) over a four year period, focusing on data from July 2013, June 2014, June 2015, and June 2016 for both customers and subscribers. Total trips have not increased year-on-year for either user. From 2013 to 2016, subscriber numbers have almost doubled. Customer numbers decreased from 2013 to 2014. They have increased since 2014, but in 2016 were still only 90% of 2013 numbers. The number of trips made by subscribers in 2013 was ~4x that of customers. In 2016, that factor had doubled to ~8x. </p>
